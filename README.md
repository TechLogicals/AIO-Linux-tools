# AIO Linux tools
 tools to make linux easier :)

This repositary is being worked on at the moment.

Currently there is a seedbox install script that installs a torrent downloader of your choice, jackett,
sonarr, radarr, plex , syncthing, jellyfin and can get you lets encrypt ssl certs too.
(Currently rtorrent is not working, but we are fixing :) )

There is also seedbox-docker which does the same but installs everything with docker images
and sets up shared directory so you can automate your downloads.

The ollama script will install and configure ollama ai on your system and will setup gpu acceleration.

The libvirt script configures your system for pci passthrough if you want it and also installs
and configures virt-manager, qemu and looking glass if you want that. also sets up the virtual 
networks you need as well

The utils script installs and configures various utilities that you can select.

The Desktops script installs different desktops on your system and configures them.

ALL THESE SCRIPTS WORK ON MOST LINUX OPERATING SYSTEMS. Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora , arch etc
